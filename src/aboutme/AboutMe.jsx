              {'When I was a about 7, I wanted a grilled cheese sandwhich. My dad was busy hanging curtains in our new house and I was hungry. The need for a grilled sandwhich was strong. I put on my thinking cap and got a brilliant idea: get a piece of white bread, spread butter on it (using it as an adhesive), and put a slice of cheese on the butter. Obviously it didn\'t work. I was scared to get in trouble, so I snuck the toaster in to the bathroom and tried scraping out the cheese. Idk whatever.'}

From a young age I\'ve always loved solving challenges and making things, which has followed me into adulthood. My forray into the workforce has brought me on a journey doing administrative assistant tasks, helping people get food and health benefits as a caseworker, and to (most recently) a Health Information manager at a nursing home.'}

I had previously thought about going back to school for a traditional computer science degree, but being a mom of 3 and struggling with advanced math in the past (trigonometry suuuuuuucks) I thought that was out of reach.'}

              {'In January 2021, A friend I knew posted about a software bootcamp in slack. I\'ve heard of them before, but I have always been skeptical. She had actually gone through a bootcamp years ago, being a career changer herself and landed a job. I did some research and was still iffy on taking the jump. I\'ve previously done some freeCodeCamp in the past. I found a school called Turing School of Software and Design. They were offering a "try it coding" weekend. The first day was we explored the backend and did a little Ruby. Meh it was ok. The next day we checked out the front and and coded in JavaScript. OMG I was HOOKED. It blended my love of problem solving and making things. I like to say it\'s the ultimate craft, except glitter doesn\'t follow me around for weeks and I don\'t have to clean up anything. I started the bootcamp in May 2021 and here we are today, making websites and still drawing in MS Paint. (ok, it\'s JS Paint online, same thing).'}
